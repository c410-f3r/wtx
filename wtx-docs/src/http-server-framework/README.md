# HTTP Server Framework

A small and fast to compile framework that can interact with many built-in features.

* Databases
* JSON
* Middlewares
* Streaming
* URI router
* WebSocket

If dynamic or nested routes are needed, then please activate the `matchit` feature. Without it, only simple and flat routes will work.

To use this functionality, it is necessary to activate the `http-server-framework` feature.
