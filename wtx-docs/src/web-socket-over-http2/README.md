# WebSocket over HTTP/2

At the current time only servers support the handshake procedure defined in [RFC8441](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8441).

While HTTP/2 inherently supports full-duplex communication, web browsers typically don't expose this functionality directly to developers and that is why WebSocket tunneling over HTTP/2 is important.

1. Servers can efficiently handle multiple concurrent streams within a single TCP connection
2. Client applications can continue using existing WebSocket APIs without modification

For this particular scenario the `no-masking` parameter defined in <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-damjanovic-websockets-nomasking-02> is also supported.

To use this functionality, it is necessary to activate the `http2` and `web-socket` features.

## Example

```rust,2024,no_run
{{#rustdoc_include ../../../wtx-instances/http2-examples/http2-server-web-socket.rs}}
```
